// Runtime-safety (`@alloc(false)`) checking.
//
// "clean" means a function performs no heap allocation, transitively. The
// analysis is a greatest fixpoint over the call graph:
//
//   * extern    -> clean iff annotated `@alloc(false)` (we trust the user);
//                  an unannotated extern is an allocating leaf.
//   * intrinsic -> always clean (dropped during call collection).
//   * function  -> clean iff every callee is clean.
//
// We can't do this in a single definition-order pass, modules are flattened with
// imports appearing *after* the module that imports them, so a callee can be
// defined later in the program than its caller. The fixpoint starts every function
// optimistically clean and propagates dirtiness until it stabilizes, which is
// order-independent and handles (mutual) recursion correctly.

/// Map from a callable's final (post-mono) name to whether it is known clean.
type CleanMap<'a> = HashMap<&'a str, bool>;

/// Sentinel "callee" for an indirect call through a function pointer. Its target
/// isn't statically known, so we can't prove it clean — it never appears in the
/// clean map, so any function that makes one is forced dirty. Not a valid
/// identifier, so it can't collide with a real callable's name.
const INDIRECT_CALLEE: &str = "<indirect call>";

/// Returns the immediate calls in this expression whose callee is dirty.
// `locals` is the stack of param/`let` names in scope at this point (see the
// rewriter in module.rs for the same shape). a called name that's shadowed by a
// local isn't the top-level symbol of that name: it's an indirect call through a
// value, so we route it to INDIRECT_CALLEE instead of the clean-map lookup.
